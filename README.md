# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression and ensemble methods. The model achieves high accuracy and reduces false positives through feature engineering and sampling techniques.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in the financial domain to detect fraudulent transactions. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, so careful attention is given to class imbalance using under-sampling techniques.

- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression (with ensemble comparisons)
- **Accuracy:** 87%
- **False Positive Reduction:** 23% improvement after optimization

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Logistic Regression model for binary classification
- Feature engineering for improved signal extraction
- Data balancing with random under-sampling
- Evaluation using confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and classification report
- Ensemble comparison (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost for benchmarking)

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn (for EDA & visualization)
